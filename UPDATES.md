The following placeholders have been updated to be more professional and clear:

### 📝 Still Using Placeholders (Acceptable)

These are fine to keep as placeholders for a portfolio repository:

1. **API Domain**: `https://api.example.com`
   - Acceptable for portfolio/demo purposes
   - Can be updated if you have a public API

2. **Demo URLs**: `https://demo.example.com`
   - Acceptable for portfolio
   - Update if you have live demos

### ✅ Ready for Publishing

All placeholders are now:
- Professional and clear
- Don't expose personal information
- Easy to update when needed
- Safe for public view

**Next Steps**:
1. Update `[your-org]` in `contracts/openapi.yaml` with your GitHub username/org
2. Update `security@example.com` in `SECURITY.md` with your security contact (optional)
3. Update copyright in `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` with your name/organization (optional)
4. Update API/demo URLs if you have live services (optional)

All updates are optional - the repository is safe to publish as-is.
